// Package push delivers a notification to a browser.
//
// It is this project's replacement for `internal/mailer`, and it is a
// deliberately smaller thing. A mailbox can be temporarily full, so mail
// needed a retry ladder, a delivery history and a notion of an address going
// inactive; a push endpoint is either there or it is gone, so the whole of the
// failure story here is: send once, and delete the endpoint the service says
// no longer exists.
//
// # What it does and does not know
//
// It knows how to encrypt a payload to a browser's keys and sign it for a push
// service. It does not know what a notification is for, who should get one, or
// whether one has already been sent — the store holds the notification, this
// sends the tap on the shoulder, and keeping the two apart is what makes it
// true that nothing exists only as a push.
