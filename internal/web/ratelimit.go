// Bounds is what one address may do in a minute, by what it costs.
//
// Three numbers rather than one, because the three are not the same request.
// An asset is read out of the binary and costs a memcpy; a page fans out to
// several backend calls and a database behind them; a write changes something
// and, for a submission, eventually costs a model call. An operator tuning one
// of those should not have to move the others.
type Bounds struct {
	// Assets is the embedded files and the theme overlay. High, because a
	// browser pulls a dozen per page and a reader must never spend their
	// allowance on a stylesheet.
	Assets int

	// Pages is everything that reads through to the backend.
	Pages int

	// Writes is everything that changes something.
	Writes int
}

// DefaultBounds is deliberately generous, and the reason is who reads this
// site.
//
// # Why an address is a poor name for a reader
//
// A village shares one address. So does a workplace, a library, a school, and
// so does a mobile carrier's whole CGNAT pool — which can be tens of thousands
// of people on one IPv4 address. The people this site is for are exactly the
// ones most likely to be reading it from a works council's office or a union
// hall's wifi, so a limit tight enough to stop a determined script is a limit
// that refuses a whole workplace, and that is a worse outcome than serving an
// attacker.
//
// # So what is this actually for
//
// Two things, honestly stated, and neither is "stopping a distributed attack".
//
// It stops one client taking the site down by accident — a broken loop, a
// crawler with no delay, a retry storm — which is the failure that actually
// happens. And it bounds **writes**, where the numbers are at least a
// different shape: a person follows a few things and says they are coming to
// a few more.
//
// # Where the write number comes from
//
// Not from what a flooder would want, because at any value a crowd behind one
// NAT can live with, a flooder with a generator is still comfortable. It comes
// from the other end: the busiest honest minute one address can produce.
// "I'm coming" is a form post, so a meeting where the chair says "everybody
// sign up now" is already dozens of writes a minute from one wifi, and
// refusing them would break the site at the moment it is being used as
// intended.
//
// What actually stands between a script and ten thousand accounts is the
// **ceremony limiter in the backend** — ten at once and ten a minute per
// address, on beginning a signup. This bound is not that, and is not a
// substitute for it.
//
// Anything beyond belongs in front of this service, or in the proof-of-work
// this project has already named as the next step.
var DefaultBounds = Bounds{Assets: 3000, Pages: 600, Writes: 120}

// assetPaths are served without a database behind them.
//
// `/theme/` is in here although it does reach the backend, because it has a
// cache of its own and a reader pulls it on every page exactly like a
// stylesheet — which is what it is.

// RateLimited bounds every route by the address it came from.
//
// Service-level middleware rather than a decoration on the handlers that
// looked risky: the route somebody forgets to bound is always the one that
// needed it, and a limit declared per handler is a limit the next handler is
// copied without. Everything is bounded and the classification decides how
// generously.
//
// A bound of zero or less switches that class off rather than refusing
// everything, so an operator cannot take their own site down with a typo.
