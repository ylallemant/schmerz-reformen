// The Content-Security-Policy is the second line of defence, and it exists
// because the first one is a promise rather than a mechanism.
//
// Escaping is what stops stranger-supplied text becoming script: `html/template`
// escapes everything and the browser code builds no markup from data. That is
// the real defence and it is not changing. But it is a property somebody has to
// keep, in a site whose pages are made almost entirely of what strangers
// wrote, and one missed escape anywhere would otherwise be arbitrary script on
// this origin.
//
// # What that would cost, now that accounts exist
//
// The session cookie is `HttpOnly`, so injected script cannot read it. It does
// not need to. The browser attaches that cookie to same-origin requests by
// itself, so a script on the page can simply ask this site to register another
// passkey and be answered. That is persistent account takeover, it survives
// signing out, and `HttpOnly` does nothing whatever about it.
//
// # Nonces rather than hashes
//
// Several pages carry an inline script, and most of them are not static: the
// console renders its translated strings into one. A hash would have to be
// recomputed for every such block and would break the moment a translation
// changed. A nonce is minted per response and put on every inline block the
// templates render.
//
// The nonce is worth nothing unless it is unpredictable per response, which is
// why it comes from crypto/rand rather than from anything cheaper.

// nonceKey carries the per-request nonce.

//
//   - **script-src is 'self' and a nonce, with no CDN.** That is what the map
//     libraries were vendored for; see static/third-party/leaflet/PROVENANCE.md.
//   - **img-src allows data: and the tile server.** A device-linking QR code is
//     a data URI on purpose — the token is in it, and an image URL carrying a
//     credential is one every cache on the way writes down — and the map is
//     made of tiles.
//   - **connect-src is 'self'.** The passkey and push flows post to this
//     origin, which forwards them; nothing in a page talks to the backend.
//   - **form-action 'self'** so an injected form cannot post somewhere else,
//     and **frame-ancestors 'none'** so no other site can frame this one and
//     collect a click meant for us.
//   - **base-uri 'none'**, because a `<base>` tag would otherwise re-point
//     every relative URL on the page, including the scripts.
