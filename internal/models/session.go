// Session is one signed-in device.

// Tokens are per device because a person on a phone and a laptop holds two
// independent sessions, each individually revocable: signing one device out
// must not sign the others out.
//
// A session is proved by a passkey rather than by a link in a mailbox, which
// is what lets an account hold no personal data at all. What is stored is a
// hash, as everywhere else: the site cannot act as somebody, and cannot be
// made to.
