// Package ratelimit bounds how often one caller may do something.
//
// It exists because of what an account here costs to make: a fingerprint and
// a second. There is no mailbox to prove — that is the point of the account
// model — so nothing slows a script down but this, and a follower count is
// only worth showing while minting ten thousand accounts is not free.
//
// It is deliberately small and in-memory. A limiter shared across instances
// needs a store, a store needs a deployment decision, and a deployment
// decision is how "there is no rate limiting at all" survives for another six
// months. One process bounding itself is most of the value; the note in the
// plan says what would replace it.
