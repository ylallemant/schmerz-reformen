// Package authentik talks to the identity provider the console's staff
// authenticate against.
//
// # Hand-rolled, like internal/llm
//
// authentik publishes an OpenAPI schema and a generated client for it. The
// generated client is enormous — hundreds of models for an API this uses nine
// endpoints of — and it would arrive with its own HTTP handling, its own
// retries and its own idea of logging, none of which match what the rest of
// this project does. Nine calls are cheaper to write than a dependency to keep
// in step.
//
// Every field name and every required field below was read out of authentik's
// own `schema.yml` rather than remembered, which matters more than usual here:
// nothing in this package can be tested against a real instance from a unit
// test, so the shapes are the part most likely to be wrong and the part worth
// being certain about.
//
// # What it is allowed to touch
//
// This site's own objects: its OAuth2 provider, its application, its groups,
// and the people in them. It creates no flows, edits no flow bindings
// and changes nothing instance-wide. An operator's authentication flow is
// shared with every other application in their directory, and a tool that
// provisions itself has no business rewriting it — so where this needs
// something instance-wide it **checks and reports** rather than configuring.
// See Preconditions.
