// Package secret encrypts the credentials this site stores in its own
// database.
//
// # What it is for, and what it is not
//
// The backend keeps the identity provider's credentials in a row: the OAuth
// client secret the console signs editors in with, and the API token that can
// create people in the operator's directory. That reuses the storage the
// backend already has rather than adding a secret store, and without this a
// database backup would carry both in a form anybody could use.
//
// With it, a dump, an old backup, a disk somebody forgot to wipe: all inert
// without the deployment's key, which does not live in the database.
//
// **It does nothing against a compromised running backend.** The process must
// hold the key to use the credentials, so whoever reads its memory or its
// environment has both. And the key must not be backed up beside the database,
// or nothing whatever was gained. Neither of those is a flaw in the mechanism;
// they are the limits of what encryption at rest means, and they are worth
// saying in the one place somebody reads before trusting it.
//
// # Authenticated, not merely encrypted
//
// AES-GCM, so a value somebody edited in the database is refused rather than
// decrypted into something. The failure mode this prevents is specific and
// nasty: a settings row quietly altered to point the console at a different
// identity provider would otherwise be an authentication takeover that looks
// like a configuration change.
