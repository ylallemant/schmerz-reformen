// Package passkey is this site's WebAuthn relying party.
//
// It wraps `go-webauthn` rather than being used directly from the handlers,
// for the reason the rest of this project keeps its boundaries in packages of
// their own: a ceremony is two requests with a server-held challenge between
// them, and the rules about what may be carried between those requests are
// the security property. Spreading them across handlers is how one of them
// ends up trusting something the client sent.
//
// It is named for the thing rather than the library. WebAuthn is one
// implementation of "somebody proves they hold a key"; the handlers ask this
// package, not a vendor.
